## COVID-19 Symptom Reporter

## Inspiration

We all want to be safe and self isolate but we don't know how widespread this outbreak is nor do we see a reason to stay inside. If we were to know how are others are coping around us, we may be encouraged to self isolate more. We can also use this data to identify new areas where people are getting sick.

## What it does

Maps anonymous symptom and COV-19 statuses across the globe

## How I built it

## Challenges I ran into

Learning clustering and geospatial queries with mongo

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of

It's pretty secure for a hackathon - it includes recaptchas and a session to discourage false reporting and bots.

## What I learned

Clustering and coordinates are not trivial even with all the libraries.

## What's next for COV-19 Symptom Reporter

Improve the map and allow users to zoom out further and move around to see other areas. Guide the user with tooltips to make it easier to understand how it works.

## Available Scripts

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
